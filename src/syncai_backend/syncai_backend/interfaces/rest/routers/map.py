        The body is the cells themselves: exactly ``width * height`` bytes in

        PNG or base64-in-JSON because it is what the editor already holds — the
        client's buffer goes out as a memcpy and the server writes it into a P5
        body verbatim, so there is no encode, no decode, and no chance of a
        colour-managed round trip shifting 205 to 204. (The GET side had to pass
        ``colorSpaceConversion: "none"`` to stop exactly that.) The cost is ~1.6
        MB on the wire per save, on a robot LAN, once per operator edit.

        A plain ``def``, like everything else here, and that is load-bearing: this
        handler fsyncs a multi-megabyte write and then parks on
        ``MapGateway.reload_map`` for up to 25 s. On the event loop that would
        stall every other request in the process, the telemetry WebSocket
        included. ``bytes = Body(...)`` is what makes it possible — FastAPI reads
        the body in its async layer and hands the finished bytes to the
        threadpool. The alternative (``async def`` + ``await request.body()`` +
        ``run_in_threadpool`` twice) buys nothing — a ``bytes`` body parameter
        already receives the raw payload whatever the Content-Type header says;
        the ``media_type`` here is OpenAPI documentation, not enforcement — and
        needs two threadpool hops a later edit can silently drop.

        Cell *values* are deliberately not validated. map_io.cpp classifies by
        range (occupied <= 89, unknown 90..205, free >= 206) under the
        ``negate: 0 / 0.65 / 0.196`` every gridmap.yaml here carries, and two of
        the real maps already contain 255s from a round of hand-editing in GIMP.
        A ``{0, 205, 254}`` whitelist would refuse to save a map this same round
        trip just handed the client. The length is the only thing that can make a
        file map_server would misread.

        No body-size cap either: the payload is already in memory by the time
        this runs, so rejecting on Content-Length would mean streaming, and this
        whole API is unauthenticated on a robot LAN — a cap is middleware's job.
